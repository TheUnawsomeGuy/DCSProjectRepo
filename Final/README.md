## üèõÔ∏è Consistency Models Deep Dive

### Sequential Consistency
```
Operation Flow:
Client -> Central Coordinator -> Assign Sequence -> Broadcast to All Nodes
```
- **Guarantee**: All nodes see operations in same order
- **Trade-off**: Higher latency for stronger consistency

### Eventual Consistency
```
Update Flow:
Node Updates Locally -> Periodic Sync -> Eventually Consistent
```
- **Guarantee**: Convergence given no new updates
- **Trade-off**: Temporary inconsistency for better performance

### Client-Centric Consistency
```
Client Flow:
Write Operation -> Version Tracking -> Read from Suitable Node
```
- **Guarantee**: Read-your-writes, monotonic reads
- **Trade-off**: Balanced consistency and performance

## üóÇÔ∏è Naming Services Comparison

| Feature | Flat Naming | Structured Naming | DNS Simulation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Lookup Time** | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) + Network |
| **Organization** | None | Hierarchical | Domain-based |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Good | Excellent |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Use Case** | Local services | Organized systems | Internet-scale |

## üéØ Trade-off Analysis

### Performance vs Consistency
- **Strong Consistency**: Higher latency, guaranteed correctness
- **Eventual Consistency**: Lower latency, temporary inconsistency
- **Client-Centric**: Balanced approach with per-client guarantees

### Naming Service Trade-offs
- **Flat**: Fast but unorganized
- **Structured**: Organized but requires path management
- **DNS**: Scalable but network-dependent

### Threading vs Process Design
- **Threading**: Shared memory, faster communication
- **Processes**: Isolation, better fault tolerance
- **Current Choice**: Threading for simulation simplicity
